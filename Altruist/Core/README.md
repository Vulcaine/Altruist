# Altruist Core

Altruist is a powerful, on-premise game server framework designed to provide plug-and-play ease of integration for game developers. The goal of this framework is to simplify the process of creating scalable, high-performance game servers with robust features, making it easier to develop, deploy, and maintain online multiplayer games.

Whether you're building a small indie game or a large-scale multiplayer environment, Altruist aims to be a flexible solution that can meet the needs of game developers, while allowing them to focus on building the game itself, rather than worrying about the complexities of the server infrastructure.
