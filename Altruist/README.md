# Altruist Framework

Altruist is a high-performance game server framework for real-time applications. It simplifies infrastructure setup, offering easy integration for transport, database, caching, and game mechanics.

# Features
- Optimized for Real-Time: Handles many concurrent connections with minimal overhead.

- **Cycle Attribute:** Control method execution rates (e.g., Hz30, Hz60).

- **Plug-and-Play Portals:** Easily create and integrate custom portals for game mechanics, chat, and more.

- **Flexible Caching & Database Integration**: Supports integration with any caching or database provider. Currently, Redis (for caching) and ScyllaDB (for persistence) are implemented out of the box. The framework is designed for easy extensibility to other providers.

- **Auto Object Mapping:** Automatically map objects to persistence layers.

- **Game Tools:** Pre-built portals for movement, session management, and auto-saving.

## Quick Start

Hereâ€™s how you can quickly set up your game server infrastructure using Altruist:

```csharp
using Altruist;
using Altruist.Redis;
using Altruist.Web;
using Portals;

AltruistBuilder.Create(args, serviceBuilder => serviceBuilder.AddGamingSupport())
    .NoEngine()
    .WithWebsocket(setup => setup.MapPortal<SimpleGamePortal>("/game"))
    .WithRedis(setup => setup
        .AddDocument<Connection>()
        .AddDocument<WebSocketConnection>()
        .AddDocument<Spaceship>()
        .AddDocument<RoomPacket>())
    .WebApp()
    .StartServer();
```

### Steps:
- **WebSocket:** Configure transport and map portals.

- **Redis:** Add documents for caching and persistence.

- **Start:** Launch your server with .StartServer().

## Create your portal

```csharp
namespace GameGateway.Portals
{
    public class SpaceshipGamePortal : AltruistSpaceshipGamePortal
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

The SpaceshipGamePortal inherits from AltruistSpaceshipGamePortal. This base class provides common functionalities for handling spaceship-related game logic, like joining the game or processing interactions.

When you create a portal like this, it automatically enables functionalities like room management, player session management, and the basic communication flow between the client and server. The only thing you need to know is which portal you have to plug in :)
